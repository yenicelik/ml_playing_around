# Britney - The DailyMai( imitator

I started writing britney because I wanted to learn on how to use tensorflow. Britney generates text by learning to predicting character patterns found in an input.
You can find Karpathy's excellent article [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) here.
I have of course tried to implement the tensorflow model myself. As this was my first attempt, you can see how I did in the **Scrappy The Latino** folders in the root of this repo.
However, over time, this more and more aligned with the model whose functions I tried to imitate. These awesome pre-existing models were written by [sherjilozair](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow). 
If you are reading this sherjilozair - which I think is highly unprobable - thank you so much for providing your code! Implementing the LSTM in TensorFlow is not an easy task for a beginner, but definitely doable with the help of your code!

Enjoy the code! I will soon upload the scraped website contents which include all DailyMai( (paranthesis, because I'm not sure if there's a trademark on the name).
from December 2015 until November 2016 here so that you can build your own clickbait site :).

If you want to learn how to build your own machine learning library (from scratch), check out [this course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), also taught by Andrej Karpathy.
