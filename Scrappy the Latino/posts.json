effort to add further limits to what is already one of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">However, the proposal must still go to a vote to the full

(AP Photo/Alik Keplicz)</p>\n</div><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The vote in a chaotic and emotional session on Wednesday evening came after the abortion ban proposal sparked massive protests on Monday, with large numbers of women across the nation donning black, boycotting work and school and demonstrating in the streets.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It came just before the European Parliament held an emotional debate on the situation of women in Poland. Some members called for the need to save unborn lives.

Some said they don't approve of imposing criminal sentences on women who seek abortions. The proposal under discussion calls for prison terms of up to five years for both the women and their doctors.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Law and Justice leader in parliament, Ryszard Terlecki, said after the vote that the ruling party doesn't support the radical draft law.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">He said the party is working on a separate draft that would largely leave the current law as it is but limit abortions in cases of Down Syndrome, which are now allowed.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Earlier Wednesday, Jaroslaw Gowin, the minister of science and higher education, said the protests by women have \"caused us to think and taught us humility\" and that \"there will not be a total abortion ban.\"</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Mariusz Dzierzawski, from the committee Stop Abortion, which initiated the proposal, said he hopes it might still return to the commission level.

In practice, though, some doctors, citing moral objections, refuse to perform even legal abortions. Polish women seeking abortions typically get them in Germany or other neighboring countries or order abortion pills online.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The anti-abortion initiative gathered 450,000 signatures in support of the total abortion ban and is supported by the Roman Catholic Church.</font></p><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\">\n\n\n    <img id=\"i-5af4670a5468457d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/05/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:5ac8abd791ff4d7a9233831c89ac5f2e-1nGiCgT06ob1dee826a52e9e7e6d-861_634x418.jpg\" height=\"418\" width=\"634\" alt=\"A sea of thousands of umbrellas of women and men participating in a nationwide ìBlack Mondayî strike to protest a legislative proposal for a total ban on abo...\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\">\n\n<p class=\"imageCaption\">A sea of thousands of umbrellas of women and men participating in a nationwide ìBlack Mondayî strike to protest a legislative proposal for a total ban on abortion, in downtown Castle Square is pictured in Warsaw, Poland, Monday, Oct. 3, 2016.

A self-made middle-class chap, nicely educated, titled, international success, and most importantly, inventor of something that minimises that scourge of neat, practical middle-class houses – dust!

ANTLER OR SAMSONITE LUGGAGE</span></font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">The middle classes do enjoy things that match. And what could be smarter than arriving at the airport for a trip to the South of France with numerous suitcases of varying sizes, but all of the same design, from a leading brand like Antler or Samsonite?</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\"><span class=\"mol-style-bold\">8. WOOD BURNING STOVE</span></font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">The wood burning stove gives suburban houses the warmth of a fire but is much cleaner. Soot stays in the stove and doesn’t mess up the living room. An open fire would be far too much hard work: there’s no nice easy-clean grate.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\"><span class=\"mol-style-bold\">9.

MULBERRY BAG</span></font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">Once a sign of the upper classes, like many things before it, the Mulberry bag is still a very smart bag but something that every middle class woman of a certain age owns. It’s a status symbol. Mulberry Middles will hunt out other Mulberry Middles at parties or in shops, but only strike up conversation if their Mulberry isn’t as nice as their own.</font></p><div class=\"artSplitter mol-img-group\">    <div class=\"mol-img\">\n\n    <img id=\"i-44a88b9a5468f535\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/22/23/38B2DAE500000578-3802979-image-m-87_1474582738337.jpg\" height=\"969\" width=\"634\" alt=\"A Mulberry bag is a must-have for the middle classes, says William Hanson, etiquette expert\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\">\n</div>    <p class=\"imageCaption\">A Mulberry bag is a must-have for the middle classes, says William Hanson, etiquette expert</p></div><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\"><span class=\"mol-style-bold\">11. COASTERS</span></font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">Perhaps the most middle class of all things to have in a house is a set of coasters. Even more middle class, however, matching coasters. Entering a sitting room and seeing neat little matching squares or discs purposefully and considerately placed at regular intervals, territorially marking out where you are supposed to sit and place your drink is an obsession only found in Middle England, where no one wants their flat-pack furniture marked.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\"><span class=\"mol-style-bold\">12. BOILING WATER TAPS</span></font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">A boring old kettle? Who’d want one of those? Having to wait for it to boil?

For upper class houses the older and rustier the Aga the better – and preferably oil or gas.

There’s no better way to intimidate your friends by the size of your fridge freezer. Big is beautiful. An ice machine means extra points, as it’s an extra gadget and function for your fridge, which is given the same love as one of your children.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\"><span class=\"mol-style-bold\">16. BROMPTON BIKE</span></font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">The middle classes are much heralded for their practicality and what could be more practical than a bike that folds away and can be easily carried?

style=\"font-size:1.2em\">But the landlord of a nearby pub, who did not want to be named, said he moved the bike next to some bins after finding it dumped outside his premises earlier in the week.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">He said: 'On Wednesday it was outside at about 10am.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font

added: 'Given the credibility of the witness account, we have no reason to disbelieve the account.'</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">Police had 'absolutely no

mol-style-italic\">Around 9.30am today Hillary Clinton left the 9/11 ceremony in New York City and it wasn't until 11 a.m. that reporters were told why she had left and where she headed, with her campaign saying she felt 'overheated' and was recovering at daughter Chelsea's Manhattan apartment. While a 'pool' of reporters accompanied Clinton to the service, the Clinton campaign has so far refused to agree to what is called a 'protective pool,' which is how President Barack Obama's movements are covered. The White House and the White House Correspondents Association have agreed to a set of rules that include having reporters travel with the president in motorcades and cover his arrivals and departures from the White House and events. Those rules would have required that the Clinton campaign allow reporters to accompany Clinton to Chelsea's house today while she recovered, though the campaign may have still kept reporters at an arm's distance from the candidate, as she wobbled into her black van. Donald Trump's campaign has also not allowed a protective pool to cover the Republican hopeful. Twice recently the billionaire has ditched his traveling press in another city, while heading elsewhere. The first time, Trump and his running mate Mike Pence headed to Louisiana to survey flood damage. The Trump campaign also sent the press plane ahead to Phoenix, Arizona, while the candidate headed to Mexico to meet with the country's president. Reporters covering Clinton have pressed again and again for a protective pool but had let up in recent days as the candidate started answering more questions from journalists on the campaign trail. No doubt today's events will renew this discussion.</span></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em\"></font></p><div class=\"mol-img-group xwArtSplitter\">    <div class=\"mol-img\">\n\n    <img id=\"i-c31e5a2a8622a470\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/11/17/383496E000000578-3784098-She_suspended_her_campaign_on_Sunday_as_a_mark_of_respect_for_th-a-54_1473610779239.jpg\" height=\"642\" width=\"962\" alt=\"She suspended her campaign on Sunday as a mark of respect for those who died\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\">\n</div>    <p class=\"imageCaption\">She suspended her campaign on Sunday as a mark of respect for those who died</p></div><div class=\"mol-img-group xwArtSplitter\">    <div class=\"mol-img\">\n\n    <img id=\"i-cd776f73e6fda98\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/11/17/38345AE200000578-3784098-Earlier_on_Sunday_she_was_seen_wearing_sunglasses_as_she_arrived-a-51_1473610779022.jpg\" height=\"642\" width=\"962\" alt=\"Earlier on Sunday, she was seen wearing sunglasses as she arrived in New York&nbsp;\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\">\n</div>    <p class=\"imageCaption\">Earlier on Sunday, she was seen wearing sunglasses as she arrived in New York&nbsp;</p></div><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em\">The fainting spell could lend proof to conspiracy theories that Trump's allies have pushed and the candidate's claim that Clinton doesn't have the 'stamina' to hold the Oval Office.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em\">Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, that brought the health theories into the mainstream by saying on Fox News Sunday last month that voters should 'go online and put down 'Hillary Clinton's illness.'

of me, I knew it was best to stay in the safe place.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I made a few attempts to walk out from the hut, but my feet, the

was not only the most eagerly awaited event of Rio 2016, but a personal grudge match between the Jamaican and American ace sprinters.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font

class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">The sprinter was unimpressed when Gatlin focused on the six-times Olympic gold medalist's slight injury worries earlier this summer, claiming the champion had been given 'a medical pass' to compete after missing the Jamaican trials.</font></p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em\">'He's injured, gets a
